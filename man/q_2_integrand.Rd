\title{Integrand for q_2 calculation}
\usage{
q_2_integrand(y, x0, k1, k2, b_siler)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{The integration variable (age of illness onset)}

\item{x0}{The starting age}

\item{k1}{The constant transition rate from the healthy state to the ill state}

\item{k2}{The factor by which the mortality hazard out of the ill state is
larger than that out of the healthy state}

\item{b_siler}{The parameter vector for the Siler hazard model}
}
\value{
The integrand value at y
}
\description{
Helper function for computing the integral in q_2(x0, x; w).
}
\details{
The integrand is: exp(-k1 * (y - x0)) * [S_13(0, y)]^(1 - k2).
This has the same mathematical form as p_12_integrand but uses S_13(0, y)
(survival from birth) rather than S_13(x0, y) (survival from x0), because
the q_2 formula factors the S_13 terms differently.
