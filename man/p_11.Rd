\title{Calculate the transition probability p_11(x0, x)}
\usage{
p_11(x, k1, b_siler, x0 = 0, x_cut = Inf)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The age at which to evaluate the transition probability}

\item{k1}{The constant transition rate from the healthy state to the ill
state (before x_cut)}

\item{b_siler}{The parameter vector for the Siler hazard model (baseline
mortality)}

\item{x0}{The conditional starting age [default: 0]}

\item{x_cut}{The age at which the well-to-ill transition hazard becomes
zero [default: Inf]. When x_cut = Inf, this reduces to the standard
constant hazard model.}
}
\value{
The transition probability p_11(x0, x)
}
\description{
This function computes the probability of remaining in the well state from
age x0 to age x, accounting for both the well-to-ill transition (with
cutoff) and the well-to-dead transition (baseline mortality).
}
\details{
Computes the probability of staying in the well state from age x0 to age x.
When x0 = 0, this is: p_11(0, x) = exp(-k1 * min(x_cut, x)) * S_13(0, x)

This is the probability of staying in the well state, which requires 
surviving both the well-to-ill transition and the baseline mortality hazard.
