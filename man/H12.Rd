\title{Calculate the cumulative hazard for the well-to-ill transition}
\usage{
H12(x, k1, x0 = 0, x_cut = Inf)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The age(s) at which to evaluate the cumulative hazard}

\item{k1}{The constant transition rate from the healthy state to the ill
state (before x_cut)}

\item{x0}{The conditional starting age [default: 0]}

\item{x_cut}{The age at which the hazard becomes zero [default: Inf].
When x_cut = Inf, this reduces to the standard constant hazard model.}
}
\value{
The cumulative hazard evaluated at the location(s) in x
}
\description{
This function computes the cumulative hazard for the transition from the
healthy (well) state to the ill state over the age interval [x0, x]. It
supports a single cutoff age x_cut, after which the hazard becomes zero.
This is useful for modeling conditions like Linear Enamel Hypoplasia (LEH)
that can only occur during specific age windows (e.g., 0-6 years for LEH).
}
\details{
For each age x, the cumulative hazard is calculated as:
- If x0 >= x_cut: H12 = 0 (cutoff already passed)
- If x0 < x_cut and x <= x_cut: H12 = k1 * (x - x0)
- If x0 < x_cut and x > x_cut: H12 = k1 * (x_cut - x0)

The function is vectorized over x.

Future extensions could support piecewise constant hazards with multiple
breakpoints and different hazard rates in each interval.
