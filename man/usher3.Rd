\details{
The Usher 3 illness-death model is a multi-state model that
describes the  transitions of individuals among three states: healthy, ill,
and dead. The model is parameterized by transition rates between the states,
and the Siler hazard model is used to describe the baseline mortality.

  The density rho1 represents the probability density of observing an
  individual who died in the healthy state at a given age, while rho2
  represents the probability density of observing an individual who died in
  the ill state at a given age. They are not proper densities since it is
  the some of the two, rho1 + rho2, that integrates to 1; hence, we
  sometimes call them pseudo-densities.

  The calculation of rho2 involves an integral term, which is computed using
  the \code{integrate} function in R. The integrand for this term is given
  by the \code{usher3_integrand} function.
