\title{Calculate the survival function for the well-to-ill transition}
\usage{
S12(x, k1, x0 = 0, x_cut = Inf)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The age(s) at which to evaluate the survival function}

\item{k1}{The constant transition rate from the healthy state to the ill
state (before x_cut)}

\item{x0}{The conditional starting age [default: 0]}

\item{x_cut}{The age at which the hazard becomes zero [default: Inf].
When x_cut = Inf, this reduces to the standard constant hazard model.}
}
\value{
The survival probability evaluated at the location(s) in x
}
\description{
This function computes the survival function (probability of remaining in
the healthy state) for the transition from well to ill over the age interval
[x0, x]. It supports a single cutoff age x_cut, after which the hazard
becomes zero.
}
\details{
The survival function is S12(x) = exp(-H12(x)), where H12 is the cumulative
hazard calculated by the H12 function.

When x_cut = Inf, this gives S12(x) = exp(-k1 * (x - x0)), which matches
the standard constant hazard model currently used in usher3_rho1 and
usher3_integrand.

Future extensions could support piecewise constant hazards with multiple
breakpoints and different hazard rates in each interval.
}
\examples{
# Probability of remaining healthy (not transitioning to ill)
S12(c(5, 10, 20), k1 = 0.02)

# With cutoff: survival plateaus after x_cut
S12(c(3, 6, 10), k1 = 0.02, x_cut = 6)
